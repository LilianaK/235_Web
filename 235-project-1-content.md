## Story
Temuwehat returned to his domain after a long journey, only to find that his children had been slain and his throne stolen by the vile
            Lady Weezalamos!<Now, Temuwehat must take up his sacred sword once again in order to exact his revenge and reclaim his throne. 
## Aesthetics
Pixellated animals with dramatic dialogue and clothes remniscent of the cultures in the Himalayas. Lots of cartoon blood and over-the-top action. Sprites will be made in Asperite.

## Gameplay

### Mechanics/Controls
The player controls Temuwehat, a master of warfare. They can move left and right using the A and D keys and swing their weapon by clicking. If the player is hit by an enemy attack, they lose the game.

### How is it taught?/Player Learning
A character will taunt Temuwehat at the beginning of the game, questioning his power, and slipping in the controls in their dialogue. It's a simple game that doesn't require a lot of skills to learn.
