### How is it taught?/Player Learning
A character will taunt Temuwehat at the beginning of the game, questioning his power. However, it will also slip in the player controls in its dialogue. "Return of the Crimson King" is a simple game that doesn't require a lot of skills to learn, though, and should be fairly intuitive for most players.
